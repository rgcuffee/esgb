You can document your findings electronically using the fillable fields or you may print the guide.  You will not need to turn in your guide but you will need your findings to complete the posttest. Be sure to document any questions that you might have and bring those with you to the P-ILT. <br /><br />To complete the associated posttest, click the link from the upper right corner of this screen. You will have 30 minutes to complete the posttest with a score of at least 80%. If you do not pass the posttest in three attempts, you will need to retake the associated V-ILT class. After retaking the V-ILT, you must contact the VCT/V-ILT help desk at <a href=\"tel:888-748-2687\">888-748-2687</a> and request to have your posttest reset. Ensure you prepare any questions you may have from the self-study or posttest questions to ask during the V-ILT retake session.<br /><br />Upon successful completion, be sure to enroll yourself, or waitlist, in the associated P-ILT.

You will have 30 minutes to complete the posttest with a score of at least 80%. If you do not pass the posttest in three attempts, you will need to retake the associated V-ILT class. After retaking the V-ILT, you must contact the VCT/V-ILT help desk at 888-748-2687 and request to have your posttest reset. Ensure you prepare any questions you may have from the self-study or posttest questions to ask during the V-ILT retake session.<br /><br />Upon successful completion, be sure to enroll yourself, or waitlist, in the associated P-ILT.

The iVideo demonstrates the process for the complete disassembly and reassembly of the 9T50 using the necessary special tools. Where procedures are similar, only representative examples will be shown. Removal and installation of pressed-in bearings and seals will not be presented. Interactive features of this iVideo include integrated testing, clickable \"Deep Dives\" that present additional pertinent information, and navigation aids.

The guide is provided during the associated V-ILT.<br />The activities focus on improving your diagnostic knowledge and awareness.  Please take as much time as you need to fully understand the diagnostic concepts each scenario presents.  You can document your findings electronically using the fillable fields or you may print the guide.  You will not need to turn in your guide but you will need your findings to complete the posttest. Be sure to document any questions that you might have and bring those with you to the P-ILT. <br /><br />To complete the associated posttest, click the link from the upper right corner of this screen. You will have 30 minutes to complete the posttest with a score of at least 80%. If you do not pass the posttest in three attempts, you will need to retake the associated V-ILT class. After retaking the V-ILT, you must contact the VCT/V-ILT help desk at <a href=\"tel:888-748-2687\">888-748-2687</a> and request to have your posttest reset. Ensure you prepare any questions you may have from the self-study or posttest questions to ask during the V-ILT retake session.<br /><br />Upon successful completion, be sure to enroll yourself, or waitlist, in the associated P-ILT. By adding your name to the waitlist, you are now in line and will automatically be enrolled into the next available seat in the order you appear.",

You can document your findings electronically using the fillable fields or you may print the guide.  You will not need to turn in your guide but you will need your findings to complete the posttest. Be sure to document any questions that you might have and bring those with you to the P-ILT. <br /><br />To complete the associated posttest, click the link from the upper right corner of this screen. You will have 30 minutes to complete the posttest with a score of at least 80%. If you do not pass the posttest in three attempts, you will need to retake the associated V-ILT class. After retaking the V-ILT, you must contact the VCT/V-ILT help desk at <a href=\"tel:888-748-2687\">888-748-2687</a> and request to have your posttest reset. Ensure you prepare any questions you may have from the self-study or posttest questions to ask during the V-ILT retake session.<br /><br />Upon successful completion, be sure to enroll yourself, or waitlist, in the associated P-ILT.

You can document your findings electronically using the fillable fields or you may print the guide.  You will not need to turn in your guide but you will need your findings to complete the posttest. Be sure to document any questions that you might have and bring those with you to the P-ILT. <br /><br />To complete the associated posttest, click the link from the upper right corner of this screen. You will have 30 minutes to complete the posttest with a score of at least 80%. If you do not pass the posttest in three attempts, you will need to retake the associated V-ILT class. Ensure you prepare any questions you may have from the self-study or posttest questions to ask during the V-ILT retake session. After retaking the V-ILT, you must contact the VCT/V-ILT help desk at <a href=\"tel:888-748-2687\">888-748-2687</a> and request to have your posttest reset.<br /><br />Upon successful completion, be sure to enroll yourself, or waitlist, in the associated P-ILT.

This is possible, as a portion of the work will have already been completed in your dealership.<br /><br />This P-ILT component provides a review of the self-study and a series of hands-on workstations that focus on the diagnostic techniques used to efficiently and effective diagnoses vehicle concerns related to high voltage transmission diagnosis and service.<br />By the end of this course, technicians will be able to:<ul style=\"text-align: left; margin-left: 40px;margin-bottom: 20px\"><li style='list-style:disc;' style=\"list-style:disc;\"> x </li></ul>",

        "CourseDescription": "This course is provided by the GM approved paint suppliers. The course consists of a two-part training program (product application and color tinting). This course is intended primarily for experienced paint technicians. The participant is required to demonstrate product knowledge and the ability to perform proper repairs to achieve the paint certification. Participants begin the Paint and Refinish Certification Process path by taking an online evaluation at the GM Training Website (www.gmtraining.com). If a participant passes this evaluation, he/she will then qualify to participate in an in-shop evaluation with the paint supplier. If a participant does not pass the online evaluation, he/she will need to enroll in the paint supplier's OEM courses, which are conducted at one of the paint supplier's regional training centers. When a participant passes either the online evaluation and in-shop evaluation or the OEM Certification Courses, the participant will receive GM Paint and Refinish Certification (22041.00).",
