      <h2>About East Siders Giving Back</h2>
      <p>
        We’re a group of small business owners and professionals from the east
        side of Las Vegas who believe in giving back to the community that
        shaped us. United by a passion for service, we organize local
        initiatives, support charitable causes, and provide resources to those
        in need. Born from a desire to uplift our neighbors and strengthen the
        east side, we’re committed to making a real difference. We're currently
        working toward obtaining our 501(c)(3) nonprofit status to expand our
        impact and continue serving our community.
